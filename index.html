		I am back.  As I start to work on my side projects (and having progress), I feel like documenting the journey in a presentable manner, for the sake of building my own portfolio, as well as to inpire.  Maintaining a writing habit can be difficult, hence the first step of my roadmap will be building a site generator that will simplify the publishing process and even augment it to improve my productivity.
		</p>
		<p>
		I've chosen not to use a pre-existing site generator (they are very awesome I believe) as that will hide many of the problems that I would otherwise encounter had I not used them.  Due to this, what you will probably see in the next few weeks (or months) are me building said site generator following an agile methodology.  The product of first iteration then would be what you are looking at right now, the minimally styled html backbone that will be used as template for future content.

		So let's begin the adventure!
